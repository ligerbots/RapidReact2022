Precondition:   
    Robot driven under the mid rung and a bit on the left side of it

During climbing:
    1. Raise to mid rung
        set elevator fully retracted
        set arm to the left of the bar, at around 60 degrees
        extend elevator above the bar
        drive robot backwards to let the elevator touch the bar
        retract elevator to garb the bar
        rotate arm to hook onto the bar


    
    2. Climb to the next bar
        extend elevator a bit to let go from the bar
        use the arm to turn the robot counterclockwise and elevator pointing at the next bar, the elevator should be on the left side of the next bar at this point
        extends elevator
        rotate robot clockwise to have elevator touching the next bar
        retract the elevator and continue rotating the robot AT THE SAME TIME to adjust the position of the robot while hanging on the next bar
            *the elevator should leave some spaces for the arm to rotate through under the bar later
        rotate the arm to get off from the previous bar and end up at the left side of the bar
        retract elevator fully
        rotate arm clockwise to grab onto the bar

    ...

    Repeat step 2 to get to higher hung

Postcondition after each step: 
    Elevator fully retracted
    Both the elevator and arm hooked onto the rung
